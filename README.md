I built this specifically to 1) prove I could do it and 2) solve a problem that has bothered me for years in Minecraft. 

It is a "fork" of Xisumavoid's Vanilla Tweaks... in that I took Vanilla Tweaks and reverse engineered it to learn how to make datapacks. There might be leftover bits of Vanilla Tweaks that I didn't remove, but I want to give credit where it's due, because X is incredible and a pillar in the Minecraft community.

Anyway, if you've ever wanted to keep track of when your villagers have restocked, this is a good way to do it.
